# CSCI 5502 - Data Mining - Social Media Impact On Cryptocurrency 
  

## Project Summary

Today we have massive social media Platform which changes our lifestyle and impact in ways which we cannot even imagine. Our goal is to study one such impact on the cryptocurrency today. There has been a trend that was going on social media for a longer period, which we plan to encapsulate in form of a modal and try to come up with a solution that will not only apply to one cryptocurrency but can be generalized. We plan on analyzing one social media impact - Twitter on the value of bitcoin. This paper will briefly discuss which key factors and key personnel have more effect on the value of bitcoin. Will rank the person according to the impact index and will consider the effect in value change they bring. Will then generalize the events which affect the value of bitcoin.

We will remove the outliers â€“ non-significant events and then use the Twitter Data to determine the currency price. It is important to connect the Tweets to the bitcoin currency rate. So, we are trying to come up with a model that will predict the future prices based on the current tweets using a model developed with previous tweets and previous bitcoin currency price. We all know that how tweets by some famous people influence people and in turn influence the bitcoin currency rates. Sometimes it could increase the price and sometimes decrease it.

It is also important to consider the context of the tweet to determine its influence on bitcoin currency value than just getting the influence of sentimental analysis. So, we are doing both contextual analysis and sentimental analysis to make our model more accurate in determining the value of bitcoin currency.
